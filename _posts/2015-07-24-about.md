### Hi there!

I'm Michelle, an aspiring front end web developer. I'm an ex-nomad who has lived in four different countries, Singapore, Australia, Japan and the US. I spent my college years in sunny Perth, Australia, mostly at the library, sometimes at the beach (to read and then swim). In Japan, I had the wonderful opportunity of working with some of the most wonderful people teaching English to students of all ages.

After moving to the US, I took Harvard's CS50 online and discovered that programming was enormously difficult, but also that I welcomed and enjoyed the challenge of coding. I aim to code, learn something new, and become a better version of myself everyday. I would love an opportunity for an internship or an apprenticeship.

During my downtime, I practice calligraphy, run, do yoga, bake, read and do origami. At the moment, I'm reading "The Pragmatic Programmer".
