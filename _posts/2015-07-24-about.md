### Hi there!

I'm Michelle, a front end web developer. I'm an ex-nomad who has lived in four different countries, Singapore, Australia, Japan and the US. I spent my college years in sunny Perth, Australia. I moved to Japan after graduating and had the wonderful opportunity of working with some amazing people teaching English to students of all ages.

After moving to the US, I took Harvard's CS50 online and discovered that programming was enormously difficult, but also that I welcomed and enjoyed the challenge of coding. I enjoy creating modern, responsive and visually appealing websites that are user-friendly and accessible to all. I am currently looking for a junior position as a front end developer.

During my downtime, I do calligraphy, run, bake, explore cities, read and do origami. At the moment, I'm reading "Coders at Work".
