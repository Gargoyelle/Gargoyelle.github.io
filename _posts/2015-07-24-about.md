### Hi there!

I'm Michelle, an aspiring front end web developer. I discovered a fascination for code just last year, which makes me a tad late to the party, but I'm working to catch up! 

I've coded in the basics; HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and right now, I'm working on learning about JavaScript frameworks, Node.js, dev testing and lots more!

When I'm not coding up a storm, I enjoy speedreading through novels in half a day with a strong cup of coffee, yoga, running, aikido and baking.
