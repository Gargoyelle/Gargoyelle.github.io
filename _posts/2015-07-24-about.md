### Hi there!

I'm Michelle, an aspiring front end web developer. I discovered a fascination for code just last year, which makes me a tad late to the party, but I'm working to catch up! 

I've used HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript for my projects and right now, I'm working on learning about JavaScript frameworks like Angular.js, testing, UX and lots more!

When I'm not coding up a storm, I enjoy speedreading through novels in half a day with a strong cup of coffee, yoga, running, aikido and baking.
